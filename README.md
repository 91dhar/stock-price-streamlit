# Stock Price application using the Streamlit library.

A simple stock price visualisation application made with the help of Python's Streamlit library.

### To check prices of stocks apart from the one already used in this application, just change the `tickerSymbol` to whatever symbol you want. Should be listed exactly the same on Yahoo Finance portal.

Requirements:
- import `yfinance`
- import `streamlit`
- import `pandas`

### To install `streamlit` library via the VS Code Terminal or CMD, write the following command and hit Enter: 
`pip install streamlit`

### To run the application, write the following command and hit Enter:
`streamlit run app.py` (Here, "app.py" is the file name).

Note - I did not activate the Conda environment for this application. This is still WIP as I am yet to deploy on Heroku.
